Project name: Data science; module 4
Purpose: Data science is a highly sought after skill in graduates following their degree. Our lecturer Nick, has made this module to help us explore file systems and programming tools to access, organise, analyse and visulise large datasets. With the use of R, we were able to import and process large marine monitoring dataset, and fine tuning our data visualisation skills. Nick's aim for th course  was to highlight the importance of tidy code and data management, and teach students to invest in programmed workflows to gain large efficiencies in reproducibility and useability of scientific data.

Code style: We used R markdown with packages,including, ggplot2, tidyverse, lubridate, scales, sf, terra and tmap

This current repository will have my completed module 4 workbook experiences, our plot deconstruction of the seasonal distribution of turtle nesting sites in Tanzania and our end-to-end analysis of a dataset selected from Qfish.
