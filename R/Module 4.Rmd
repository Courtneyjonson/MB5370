#2.5 Obtain the data

mpg

##The variables in the mpg data frame include: disp, which is the engine size of the cars in litres, hwy, which is the cars fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg). A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with a high fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance.
```

```{r}

#2.6 Create your first ggplot
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))


#1. ggplot() creates a coordinate system that you can add layers to. 
#2. Add data to this function, <ggplot(data = mpg)>, this will create an empty graph where you need to add your points.
#3. The next function geom_point(), will add a layer of points to your plot, which creates a scatterplot. (ggplot2 comes with many different geom functions that each add a different type of layer to a plot). 
#4. The mapping argument (geo_point()) is always paired with aes(), you will need to specify the x and y variables in the data.

##ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  ##<GEOM_FUNCTION> (mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))

#2.7.1 Aesthetic mappings
#Aesthetic can include size, colour and shape.

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = class))
#This will change the different classes in this dataset to a different colour, we can also change the size. 

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))
#This would not be a good feature to help with reading this graph as it is hard to tell the classes apart, it also is giving off that some classes are "bigger" or have "more value" then the other which this is not a correct statement for these variables. How would some else read the plot? make sure you are giving off the correct information

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class))
#This looks appealing but still may be hard to read especially people with vision problems, as some points are very transparent.

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))
#Changing the shape of the classes

##Manually changing the colour.
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "green")

#2.8 Troubleshooting

## line given: ggplot(data = mpg) 
#+ geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

#error is that the + is on the wrong line

ggplot(data = mpg) +
 geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

#2.9 Facet and panel plot
#only use facet_wrap() for discrete variables.

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
##This second plots is using two variables an spliting them up with a ~, instead using _wrap you need to use _grid. 

#if you do not want to facet in the rows or column dimension
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
facet_grid(. ~ cyl)

#Nrow and ncol - these control the number of rows and coloumns in the code.

##5.3 What is tibble? 
#install tibble: They are slightly adjusted dataframes which were designed to keep up with recent advances in R. Some things that were useful in R a decade ago, now hinder users rather than help them, so tibbles are a kind of future proof data frame. 

library(tidyverse)

str(iris)
as_tibble(iris)

tibble(
  x = 1:5, 
  y = 1, 
  z = x ^ 2 + y)

#use the old data.frame functions to create these variables - there is more steps in this way.
x = c(1,2,3,4,5)
y = c(1)
z = c(x ^ 2 + y)

tb <- tibble(
  `:)` = "smile", 
  ` ` = "space",
  `2000` = "number"
)
tb

tribble(
  ~x, ~y, ~z,
  #--|--|----
  "a", 2, 3.6,
  "b", 1, 8.5
)

tibble(
  a = lubridate::now() + runif(1e3) * 86400,
  b = lubridate::today() + runif(1e3) * 30,
  c = 1:1e3,
  d = runif(1e3),
  e = sample(letters, 1e3, replace = TRUE)
)

#You can use print() to designate the number of rows (n) and display width. (width = Inf #displays every column). Here we can see this by looking at the giant flights dataset from the nycflights package. Note how many rows there are, but also now you can see all of the columns.

install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
nycflights13::flights %>% 
  print(n = 10, width = Inf)

#You’ve a range of other things you can do to interrogate your data. Here are a few options you can set globally. 
#if more than n rows, print only m rows. 
#Use options(tibble.print_min = Inf) to always show all rows.
#Use options(tibble.width = Inf) to always print all columns, regardless of the width of the screen.
#Use R’s built-in viewer with View()
#You can see a complete list of options by looking at the package help with package?tibble.

options(tibble.width = Inf)
df <- tibble(
  x = runif(5),
  y = rnorm(5)
)
df$x
df[["x"]]
df[[1]]
df[[2,2]]

#Later on we will start to use pipes (%>%), which is a new way to do things to variables in R.
df %>% .$x
df %>% .[["x"]]

#Another benefit to tibbles is that they won’t do partial matching, which means if the variable you call out doesn’t match exactly what’s in the dataframe, tibbles will generate a warning.
df <- tibble(
    xxx = runif(5),
    y = rnorm(5)
)
df$xx 
#One of them is that they don’t always work with older functions in R. If you run into this problem, use as.data.frame() to turn a tibble back to a standard R dataframe (data.frame). 
#Some times the reason it doesn't work because of the older functions, we don't use [] 

df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
df
df$x #call by name
df[, "xyz"] #call by exact position

#5.4 How can i import data? 

read_csv("a,b,c
1,2,3
4,5,6")

#if you have metadata at the top of your file, you might want to skip these lines using skip = n where n is the number of lines you want to skip over. 

read_csv("The first line of metadata
  The second line of metadata
  x,y,z
  1,2,3", skip = 2)

read_csv("# A comment I want to skip
  x,y,z
  1,2,3", comment = "#")
#This function --> use comment = '#' will drop all lines starting with a “#” or whatever character you designate.

#read_csv() reads comma delimited files, read_csv2() reads semicolon separated files (common in countries where , is used as the decimal place), read_tsv() reads tab delimited files, and read_delim() reads in files with any delimiter.

#read_fwf() reads fixed width files. You can specify fields either by their widths with fwf_widths() or their position with fwf_positions(). read_table() reads a common variation of fixed width files where columns are separated by white space.

#Another reason to adjust the read_csv() default is if your data does not contain column names. In this case, use col_names = FALSE to tell read_csv() not to treat the first row as headings but to instead label them sequentially from X1 to Xn. 

read_csv("1,2,3\n4,5,6", col_names = FALSE)
#"\n" is simply a shortcut for adding a new line. This is a common ‘break’ in programming. 

#you can create column names by:
read_csv("1,2,3\n4,5,6", col_names = c("x", "y", "z"))

##Creating no data values

#You can also set the no data values. This is important because if you assume an empty cell is a 0, you could make a grave error in your analysis. Better to tell R that this is ‘no data’ so you can easily remove it later on.
#Another option that commonly needs tweaking is na: this specifies the value (or values) that are used to represent missing values in your file:

read_csv("a,b,c\n1,2,.", na = ".")

```

```{r}
#5.5 Tidy data.

# How we make our dataset a tidy dataset is by following three interrelated rules. 
   ##Each variable must have its own column.
   ##Each observation must have its own row.
   ##Each value must have its own cell.

#These three rules are interrelated because it’s impossible to only satisfy two of the three. That interrelationship leads to an even simpler set of practical instructions:
   ##Put each dataset in a tibble.
   ##Put each variable in a column.

#Compute rate per 10,000
table1 %>% 
  mutate(rate = cases / population * 10000)

#Compute cases per year 
table1 %>% 
  count(year, wt = cases)

#changes over time- visual 
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(table1, aes(year, cases)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = country), colour = "grey50") + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = country))

#5.5.2 Spreading and gathering data tables 

#Once you understand the data you’re looking at, the second step is to resolve one of the two common problems with untidy data. These are:
   ##One variable is spread across multiple columns
   ##One observation is scattered across multiple rows

table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to = "year", values_to = "cases")

#pivot_longer() makes datasets “longer” by increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns.

table4b %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to = "year", values_to = "population")

tidy4a <- table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to = "year", values_to = "cases")
tidy4b <- table4b %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to = "year", values_to = "population")
left_join(tidy4a, tidy4b)

#join the two new tables. 

#pivot_wider() is the opposite of pivot_longer().

 #Example
 table2 #To make this tidy we only need two parameters:the column to take variables from: type and The column to take values from: count

 #pivot_wider() to make the table shorter and wider by creating new, separate columns for cases and population and populating them with their associated values.
 
 table2 %>%
   pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = count)

#5.5.3 Seperating and uniting data tables
 
#Example
 table3 #In table3, we see one column (rate) that contains two variables (cases and population).
 #we need to split the rate column up into two variables. separate() will take the name of the column to split and the names of the columns we want it split into.
 
 table3 %>% 
   separate(rate, into =c("cases","population"))
#now have two variables in the table rather then 1 all together. 
 
 table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep = "/")
 
 table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), convert = TRUE)
 
 #You can use this arrangement to separate the last two digits of each year. This makes this data less tidy, but is useful in other cases, as you’ll see in a little bit.

 table3 %>% 
  separate(year, into = c("century", "year"), sep = 2)
 
 table5 %>% 
  unite(new, century, year, sep = "")
